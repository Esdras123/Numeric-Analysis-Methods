# Numeric-Analysis-Methods
This repository contains methods of numeric analysis such as finite differences, finite volumes (1D and 2D), method to solve second degree equations with really big coefficients.
There is also a report (in french) describing the methods, how we did to achieve them and the test cases they succeed or failed to solve
